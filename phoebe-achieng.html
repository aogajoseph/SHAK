					<p class="no-space"><i>Phoebe Achieng was born at the Pumwani maternity hospital in Nairobi Kenya. She was born with Spina bifida and Hydrocephalus. Spina bifida is a birth defect that occurs when the neural tube (the element that develops to form the spine and brain) fails to develop or close properly and Hydrocephalus an imbalance of fluids (Cerebrospinal fluid) in and out of the brain. She was raised and went to school in Nairobi.</i></p>
					<p class="no-space"><i>In January 1995, she needed a myelomeningocele repair (a surgical operation performed to repair birth defects) and ventriculoperitoneal shunting to create a drainage system for the flow of excessive fluids from the brain. These procedures were very expensive and as the surgeries delayed, her condition worsened. One day, their neighbour advised her mother to share Phoebe's story on mainstream media to raise funds for the operations. Following that advice, Juliana went with Phoebe to Standard Media Group offices where they met Yaya Muhammad, the reporter who took Phoebe’s story. The story was published on the newspapers and shared on TV and after a few days, well-wishers showed up and raised enough funds for the surgeries that saved her life. These surgeries were performed at the Gertrude Childrens’ hospital and afterwards, Phoebe’s life took a completely new turn. From rejection and isolation to hope for many families. </i></p>
					<p class="no-space"><i>A few years later, Phoebe joined school and life wasn't easy at all for people with her condition. Initially, she had been rejected but later accepted after a priest's intervention since it was a catholic school. In her schooling days, her mother visited her about three times every day to either pick or assist her with the call of nature as Spina bifida causes bladder and bowel malfunction. After a few months the school received a new principal who was kind, loving and motherly. Phoebe loved her and enjoyed her eight years of study at the school. She cherishes those memories and reserves a special place in her heart for her former schoolmates who sacrificed themselves for her and took her as family.</i></p>

					<p class="no-space"><i>In 2011, she joined secondary school where she faced feeding problems. The school wasn't able to provide special diets despite their food causing ailments and discomfort. She had to carry food from home or have her mother bring it to her. Her mother by then was expectant with Joshua, Phoebe’s younger brother and Phoebe learnt that people insinuated that she had become a burden to her mother. These sentiments hurt Phoebe’s feelings so much that she wondered whose fault it was for her to be born different. She would gradually fall into depression and eventually drop out of school.</i></p>
					<p class="no-space"><i>In 2012 she joined a vocational centre to learn computer basics, mathematics and other disciplines. She received braces to enhance her mobility but unfortunately, they caused very bad wounds on her back. A doctor from Kijabe hospital advised her to stop using the braces for the wounds to heal and recommended a surgery. When she went back to the center after the surgery, she was surprised to find her space occupied, her bed shifted to the corridor and her belongings isolated. She was broken hearted and sent home a photo to share the events. She was too stressed to concentrate in class and her mother's promise to visit as soon as she could lit up her spirit. The following day in the evening, she was relieved when she looked out the window and saw her mother, cousin and brother getting into the school. When they entered the dorm, they were saddened, they couldn't even talk. They just picked Phoebe’s belongings and left. Once again, Phoebe dropped out of school.</i></p>
					<p class="no-space"><i>In December 2013, Phoebe’s family relocated to Kijabe, Kiambu county where her mother went to work at a project for parents of children with Spina bifida and Hydrocephalus. Here, Phoebe lived a happy life. She was pleased with the opportunity to interact with children who had Spina bifida and Hydrocephalus and their parents. She also enrolled at a nearby college and completed her computer course and earned her first college certificate. Her mother was pleased with her attitude and wanted to know her future plans. However, she had noticed that Phoebe wasn’t interested in finishing primary school. She therefore invited a family friend, a reverend to be precise, to talk to Phoebe about finishing primary school and sitting her final exams. Upon the reverend's ntervention, Phoebe resumed school in 2016 where she met more or less similar challenges but managed to overcome. She studied for the two years that remained and sat her Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) in 2018. In 2019 she joined secondary school and sat her Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) in 2022 after battling countless challenges.</i></p>
					<p class="no-space"><i>Her present wish is to join college and persue computer science. Her message to parents and guardians of children with special needs and the community at large is: <strong>"You can't be human in isolation, you're human only in relationships."</strong> She belives in the saying, <strong>"Unity builds, Isolation diminishes."</strong> Phoebe's dream and greatest heart desire is building a vocational learning centre where children and youth with special needs will harness their potential without the barriers she faced. She devotes her sincere love for her mother, family members, doctors, best friends, former teachers, classmates and schoolmates.</i></p>
