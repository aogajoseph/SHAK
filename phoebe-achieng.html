					<p class="no-space"><i>Phoebe Achieng Achieng was born with Spina bifida and Hydrocephalus at the Pumwani maternity hospital in Nairobi Kenya. Spina bifida is a birth defect that occurs when the neural tube (the element that develops to form the spine and brain) fails to develop or close properly. Hydrocephalus on the other hand is an imbalance of fluids (Cerebrospinal fluid) in and out of the brain. She was raised in Shauri Moyo, Nairobi and went to Shauri Moyo Baptist kindergarten and Our Lady of Mercy primary school.</i></p>
					<p class="no-space"><i>In January 1995, Phoebe was three months old and was in dire need of two surgical procedures; A myelomeningocele repair (a surgical operation performed to repair birth defects) and ventriculoperitoneal shunting to create a drainage system for the flow of excessive fluids from the brain. These surgeries were too expensive for Phoebe’s family and the more she stayed home, the more her condition worsened. As time went by, Phoebe’s medical urgency increased and one day, a neighbour challenged Phoebe’s mother to share her story on mainstream media to seek funding for the surgeries. Following that advice, Juliana carried Phoebe on her back and went on foot to Standard Media Group offices where they met Yaya Muhammad, the reporter who took Phoebe’s story. The story was published in the newspapers and shared on TV and after a few days, well-wishers showed up and raised the funds they needed for the surgeries. These surgeries were performed successfully at the Gertrude Childrens’ hospital and afterwards, Phoebe’s life started taking a completely different turn. She went from rejection and isolation to a symbol of hope for many families in her neighbourhood. </i></p>
					<p class="no-space"><i>After a few years, Phoebe joined a normal public school to get an education. Life at school for her was tough. She met many challenges due to her condition. Initially, the school principal had rejected her because she was different from other children. Luckily, the school was catholic and Juliana approached the priest on the issue who wrote a letter ordering the school to accept Phoebe. At school, Phoebe’s mother had to visit every day several times to help her with the call of nature as her condition had affected her bladder and bowel functioning. After a few months the principal retired and his successor was kind, loving and motherly. Phoebe studied at the school for 8 years from 2003 to 2010 and these were the most amazing years in her life. She values the schoolmates who sacrificed their time for her and treated her as family.</i></p>

					</blockquote>
					<p class="no-space"><i>In 2011, she joined secondary school where feeding became a major issue. The school’s diet affected her and the school management was unable to provide special diets. She used to carry food from home and sometimes her mother took it to her. Her mother by then was expectant with Joshua, Phoebe’s younger brother and people insinuated that Phoebe was burdening her mother. These sentiments hurt Phoebe’s feelings so much so that she began to wonder if it was her fault or her parents’ that be born differently. She fell into depression and dropped out of school.</i></p>
					<p class="no-space"><i>In 2012 she joined a vocational centre where she learnt computer basics, mathematics and other disciplines. She received braces to enhance her mobility but unfortunately, they caused very bad wounds on her back. When a doctor from Kijabe hospital advised her to stop using the braces until the wounds healed, she obeyed and went home for one month for a surgery to treat the wounds. When she came back, she was surprised to find her space occupied, her belongings kept away and her bed moved to the corridor. She was just recovering from a surgery and was deeply hurt by what had happened at the centre. She sent home a photo to share the predicament and her mother promised to visit as soon as she could. The following day, she carried on but couldn’t concentrate in class fully. That evening, she looked out the window and saw her mother, cousin and brother. When they entered the dorm, they were too sad to speak. They picked Phoebe’s things and just left. Once again, Phoebe dropped out of school.</i></p>
					<p class="no-space"><i>In December 2013, Phoebe’s family relocated to Kijabe, in Kiambu county where her mother went to work at a project for parents of children with Spina bifida and Hydrocephalus. At Kijabe, Phoebe’s life changed for the better. She always had the opportunity to interact with the parents and children at the project, enrolled at a nearby college, completed her computer studies and got her certificate. Her mother was pleased with the developments and wanted to know her future plans. When her mother noticed that Phoebe wasn’t sure what she wanted, she suggested she goes back to school. Phoebe didn’t like the idea until a family friend, a reverend, intervened. He was able to convince her and she returned to school in 2016. The challenges she met there were more or less similar to those she had encountered before but she overcame. She studied there for two years and sat her Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) in 2018. In 2019 she joined the Joy Town secondary school in Thika and sat her Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) in 2022 after battling several challenges.</i></p>
					<p class="no-space"><i>Phoebe wishes to join college to advance her computer studies. She pleads with parents and guardians of children with special needs to let their children explore the world. From her experiences, she believes that isolation causes a permanent scar in the hearts of people with disabilities. Her dream is to build a vocational centre for children with special needs to help others like her get an education without going through the challenges she experienced. She sincerely appreciates her mother, teachers, family members, friends, doctors, schoolmates and classmates.</i></p>
