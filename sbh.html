							<h2 class="subtitle3">What is Spina bifida</h2>
							<p class="no-space">Spina bifida is a birth defect that occurs when the spine and spinal cord fail to form properly. It's a neural tube defect. The neural tube refers to the structure that develops to form a baby's brain, spinal cord and the tissues enclosing them.</p>
							<p class="no-space">It forms in the earliest stages of conception, typically within the first 28 days of pregnancy. In babies with spina bifida, a portion of the neural tube fails to develop or close properly, leading to spinal, bowel and bladder dysfunction. Spina bifida can range from mild to severe, depending on the type, size, location and related complications. Where necessary, the earliest medical intervention for spina bifida involves surgery — although, this doesn't always resolve the defect completely.</p>

							<h2 class="subtitle3">Types of Spina bifida</h2>
							<ol>
								<li>
									<h3 class="subtitle2"><u>Spina bifida Occulta</u></h3>
									<p class="no-space">Spina bifida Occulta is the mildest and most common type of spina bifida. It results in a small gap in one or more of the bones of the spine (vertebrae), some hair or a small protrution may also be present on the back. Most people who have spina bifida occulta don't even know they have it.</p>
								</li>
								<li> 
									<h3 class="subtitle2"><u>Meningocele</u></h3>
									<p class="no-space">This is a rare type of spina bifida which is characterized by a sac of spinal fluid bulging through an opening in the spine. No nerves are affected in this category and the spinal cord isn't contained in the fluid sac. Babies with meningocele may experience minor problems including but not limited to bladder and bowel dysfunction.</p>
								</li>
								<li> 
									<h3 class="subtitle2"><u>Lipomyelomeningocele</u></h3>
									<p class="no-space">The Lipomyelomeningocele type of spina bifida occurs when the outer part of the vertebrae fails to close completely, leaving an opening in the bones of the spine. Fatty tissues usually push through this opening and may cause compression of the nerves.</p>
								</li>
								<li> 
									<h3 class="subtitle2"><u>Myelomeningocele</u></h3>
									<p class="no-space">Also known as open spina bifida, is the most severe type. The spinal canal is open along several vertebrae (small gaps in the bones of the spine) in the lower or middle back. The membranes and spinal nerves push through this opening at birth, forming a sac on the baby's back, typically exposing tissues and nerves. This exposes the baby to life-threatening infections and may also cause paralysis of the lower limbs and bladder and bowel dysfunction.

							<blockquote class="bold no-space">
								<p>90% of children born with meningocele and myelomeningocele are usually at the highest risk of acquiring Hydrocephalus.</p>

							<h2 class="subtitle3 center">What causes spina bifida?</h2>
							<p class="no-space">The causes of Spina Bifida are not certainly known, but research has shown that about 78% of the reported cases resulted from the lack of folate in expectant women; Especially during the first trimester (three months) of pregnancy. It is therefore recommended that all women of childbearing ages eat fortified foods as regularly as possible, take folic acid supplements and ensure proper nutrition at all times.</p>

							<h2 class="subtitle3">What is Hydrocephalus</h2>
							<p class="no-space">Hydrocephalus is a condition where an abnormal build-up of fluid occurs in the brain. This fluid is known as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) — a clear, colorless fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord.</p>
							<p class="no-space">Normally, CSF should flow through the ventricles (a network of cavities within the brain) as a nutrient delivery and waste removal system for the brain. It bathes the brain and spinal cord, protecting and cushioning them from injury. Naturally, CSF should be reabsorbed into the bloodstream after circulating through the brain and spinal cord.</p>
							<p class="no-space">The body usually produces the CSF it needs for each day and then reabsorbs it into the bloodstream after it flows through the brain and spinal cord. However, when the normal flow or absorption is blocked, it results in a buildup within the brain causing the ventricles to expand. This causes pressure inside the brain and increases the size of the head. Prolonged pressure from too much CSF can lead to blindness and brain damage.</p>	
						</header>
						<header>
							<h2 class="subtitle3">Types of Hydrocephalus</h2>
							<p class="no-space">Hydrocephalus occurs in the brain when the levels of CSF produced and absorbed is not balanced. This condition can be classified in different categories based on the nature of CSF blockage and imbalance.</p>
						</header>
						<header>
							<p>
								<ol>
									<li>
										<h3 class="subtitle2"><u>Communicating (non-obstructive) Hydrocephalus.</u></h3>
										<p class="no-space">This form occurs after the CSF produced is trapped in the brain but it can still flow between the brain ventricles.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<h3 class="subtitle2"><u>Non-communicating (Obstructive) Hydrocephalus.</u></h3>
										<p class="no-space">This form occurs when the CSF produced is trapped in the brain and blocked in one or more of the narrow passages that connect the ventricles. This blockage may arise from a malformation or a narrowing of some kind.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<h3 class="no-space subtitle2"><u>Congenital Hydrocephalus</u></h3>
										<p class="no-space"> This form of Hydrocephalus is mostly present at birth. It may also be caused by other issues such as infections or trauma during fetal development. Congenital Hydrocephalus may be linked to other birth defects affecting the spine.</p>
									</li>
									<li> 
										<h3 class="no-space subtitle2"><u>Acquired Hydrocephalus</u></h3>
										<p class="no-space">This form develops after birth. It can be caused by infections like meningitis, bleeding, injury, brain hemorrhage or tumors.</p>
									</li>
									<li> 
										<h3 class="no-space subtitle2"><u>Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH)</u></h3>
										<p class="no-space">This type usually develops in adults aged 55 or older. It often occurs after a head trauma, an infection or an internal bleeding in the brain.</p>
									</li>
									<li> 
										<h3 class="no-space subtitle2"><u>Ex Vacuo Hydrocephalus</u></h3>
										<p class="no-space">This occurs when there is a damage to the brain caused by stroke or a traumatic injury. This type of Hydrocephalus may not be dangerous for some people and treatment may not be necessary.

								<p class="no-space">Treatment of hydrocephalus involves putting a shunt (a small pipe) in the brain to act as an artificial outlet for draining excessive CSF into the stomach (peritoneal).

							<h3 class="subtitle3">Relationship between Spina bifida &amp; Hydrocephalus</h3>
							<p class="medium no-space">Almost every child born with spina bifida ends up acquiring hydrocephalus if the proper medical interventions are not undertaken early enough.</p>
							<p class="medium no-space">Spina bifida may affect the nervous system, bones, muscles, kidneys and bladder and cause hydrocephalus and/or other complications.
							</p>
							<p class="medium no-space">The location on the spine where the undeveloped area occurs is called the Spina Bifida level. Since nerve damage at this point prevents functioning below it, the higher the level, the greater the impact on normal development and functioning.</p>
							<p class="medium no-space">The opening in the spinal cord also results in loss of the fluid surrounding the nervous system. This positions the brain further down into the upper spinal column than normal. When this happens, the normal flow of fluids out of the brain is obstructed, causing excessive CSF in the brain, hence Hydrocephalus.
							</p>
							<h3 class="subtitle3">Prevention &amp; Early Interventions</h3>
							<p class="medium no-space">Substantial levels of folic acid in an expectant woman's system in the early days of pregnancy is critical to preventing spina bifida.</p>
							<p class="medium no-space">Since most women become aware of their pregnancy after 28 days (after the neural tube is formed and closed), experts recommend that daily supplements of 400 micro grams (mcg) of folic acid are taken by all women of childbearing ages. Other major spina bifida treatments include fetal surgery during pregnancy or surgery on the baby right after birth.</p>
							<p class="medium no-space">Hydrocephalus on the other hand cannot be prevented but the risks of acquisition can be lowered in the following ways to protect children and adults:
								<ul class="medium no-space">
									<li><i><strong>Prenatal care.</strong> This should be done during pregnancy to reduce the chances of going into premature labor, which may lead to Hydrocephalus.</i></li>
									<li><i><strong>Vaccination.</strong> Vaccines help prevent illnesses and infections that might be linked to Hydrocephalus. Regular screening is recommeded to ensure that the child is protected against illnesses and infections that may expose the baby to Hydrocephalus.</i></li>
									<li><i><strong>Safety gear and equipment.</strong> Safety equipment such as helmets and seat belts prevent injuries to the head when driving, riding bicycles and in workplaces.</i></li>
